# Pairing exercise

Create a web application that allows searching for activities. Think about the needs of a traveler that is looking for things to do in a destination. For example, a person visiting Berlin that is interested in things to do during their visit.

This repository provides you with a basic setup and a static JSON file containing sample activity data.

## Product requirements:

- At a minimum, we expect a search feature that lists activities based on user input.
- You should build at least one API endpoint which your frontend application can use to get search results.
- Based on the provided data, you can add additional features which you think may be useful for travelers.
- User experience matters. We value the delivered product as much as we value technologies used.

## Technical requirements

- Use the tools, libraries or frameworks you think are appropriate with the following guidelines:
  - Using CLI creator tools that setup a build toolchain is fine (vue-cli, create-react-app, etc).
  - Please don't use creator apps or starter kits that setup a whole code structure for you. We want to see what you come up with.
  - We'd prefer to see actual CSS code (or a CSS in JS solution) rather than usage of a UI library.

## What you should prepare ahead of time:

- We'll expect you to share your screen while creating this application and talk us through what you're doing
  - If you're already using Bluejeans, the screen sharing functionality is available
  - Turning on Do Not Disturb mode can be helpful during the course of the exercise :)
- Clone this repository to your local machine
- There is a server/index.js file with a minimal Express setup
  - If you prefer to use another Node.js server, please install it and prepare a minimal setup ahead of time
- Setup a simple development environment with your tools of choice
- Some quick ways to get started:
  - Using vue-cli, run the following to start an app:
    - `npx @vue/cli create search-app`
  - Using React CLI, run the following to start an app:
    - `npx create-react-app search-app`
